# Cheat Sheet Displayer

Just a simple web app to view information from various cheat sheets. Built to make quick referencing of information easy.

Not intended or built to be super reusable, but you can try. Could be useful for inspiration on other Reagent projects as well.

You can see it in action on my site [here](https://thiswebsiteis.online/cheat_sheet).

You can also find a blog post describing how I created the app [here](https://thiswebsiteis.online/blog/creating-a-cheat-sheet-displayer)
